    <p><font face="MonoSpace" size="8px">A university (from Latin universitas 'a whole') is an institution of
        higher (or tertiary) education and research which awards academic
        degrees in several academic disciplines.[1] University is derived from
        the Latin phrase universitas magistrorum et scholarium, which
        roughly means "community of teachers and scholars".[2] Universities
        typically offer both undergraduate and postgraduate programs.</font></p>
