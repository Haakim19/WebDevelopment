    <p><font face="" size="5px" aline="right">History (derived from Ancient Greek ἱστορία (historía) 'inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation') is the systematic study and documentation of human past. 
        History is an academic discipline which uses a narrative to describe, examine, question, and analyze past events, 
        and investigate their patterns of cause and effect. 
        Historians debate which narrative best explains an event, 
        as well as the significance of different causes and effects. 
        Historians debate the nature of history as an end in itself, 
        and its usefulness in giving perspective on the problems of the present.</font></p>
    <p><font face="cavolini" size="5px" aline="center" color="blue">Stories common to a particular culture, 
        but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur), 
        are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends. 
        History differs from myth in that it is supported by verifiable evidence. 
        However, ancient cultural influences have helped create variant interpretations of the nature of history, 
        which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. 
        The modern study of history is wide-ranging, 
        and includes the study of specific regions and certain topical or thematic elements of historical investigation. 
        History is taught as a part of primary and secondary education, 
        and the academic study of history is a major discipline in universities.</font></p>
